DK HR resignation reason settings
=======================
The **DK HR resignation reason settings** module solves the next problem:

    The model adds a “Settings” section in the Resignation block hr.resignation.
    In the settings, a menu with the section “Settings for the reasons for resignation”
    is implemented. Implemented the ability for the user to create a list of reasons
    for dismissal with reference to the type of dismissal. After that, when choosing
    in the "Request for resignation" form, the system will prompt the user to select a
    reason from the drop-down list.
